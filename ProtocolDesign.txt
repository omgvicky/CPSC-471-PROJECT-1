## PROTOCOL DESIGN 

1) The types of messages that will be exchanged across the control chanel
  - get: Retrieve files from the server
  - put: Sends files from client to the server
  - ls: Lists the files that reside on the server
  - quit: Closes the server
  
2) Expected response from each type of message 
  - get: The server will receive the filename and then retrieve the file.
  - put: The client will send the server the filename as well as the file size.
  - ls: The server will retrieve all of the filenames in the server directory and send it to the client. The client will then display the list of files 
  - quit: The client closes the connection.

3) The message exchanges that must take place in order to set up a file transfer

4) How the receiving side will know when to start and stop receiving the file

5) How to avoid overflowing TCP Buffers
